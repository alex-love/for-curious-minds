Short answer is, I probably am not. Tech moves fast and people/companies are often going to lag behind. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning and reading up on AI so I can understand the tool better, but that&amp;rsquo;s been the extent of my studies this year.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working through the book AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundational Models. To me this is a good place to start, something applied on top of the next layer of abstraction.</description></item><item><title>What is For Curious Minds?</title><link>https://forcuriousminds.com/blog/my-dad/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://forcuriousminds.com/blog/my-dad/</guid><description>This website is dedicated to my dad who&amp;rsquo;s name I&amp;rsquo;ll omit out of respect for his love of privacy. One day I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about him but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you a few things. He left me his Kindle library, he had me and my siblings in a group chat called &amp;ldquo;For Curious Minds&amp;rdquo;, and he was never afraid to tell you how he felt. He passed away from a brain injury about 4 years ago and his mind is what I&amp;rsquo;ll miss most about him.</description></item></channel></rss>
