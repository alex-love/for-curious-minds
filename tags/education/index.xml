One day I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about him but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you this a few things. He left me his Kindle library, he had me and my siblings in a group chat called &amp;ldquo;For Curious Minds&amp;rdquo;, and he was never afraid to tell you how he felt. He passed away from a brain injury about 4 years ago and his mind is what I&amp;rsquo;ll miss most about him.</description></item></channel></rss>
